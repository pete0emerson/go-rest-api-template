# Go API Template

This is my template for a well formed REST API in Golang.

This template uses:

* [gorilla/mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) for routing
* [sirupsen/logrus](https://github.com/Sirupsen/logrus) for logging
* [spf13/viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) for configuration

The methodologies coded herein are not the only way to craft a well-formed REST API. This is just _my_ way.
Use this as you see fit. Replace the pieces that don't work for you. Let me know if you have "better" ways of doing things.
I'm not dogmatic about this; in fact, I'm always excited to see (other|easier|better|different) ways of doing things.
Sometimes those things will wrap around my brain better than what I'm doing now. This is progress! I may modify
this template in the future as I learn more and as new modules become available.
